\section{Introduction}
\projectname{} is a simulation for TODO

BS are deployed over a grid, at a distance M from neighbors.

T: value of T is the same for every AC in the system.

\section{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{k}: interarrival time of packets, RV
  \item \textbf{M}: 25 km
  \item \textbf{d}: distance between AC and BS
  \item \textbf{T}:
  \item \textbf{s}: service time, given by $s = T*d^2$
\end{itemize}

\section{Model}
% TODO high level model

Service time depends on distance between AC and BS.
Distance between AC and BS, namely \emph{d}, belongs to interval $[ 0, d_{max} [$ where $d_{max}$ can be computed as $d_{max\_in} + d_{max\_out}$, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $d_{max\_in} = \frac{M \sqrt{2}}{2} $
  \item $d_{max\_out} = vt$
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{img/dmax.pdf}
  \caption{Computation of $d_{max}$}
  \label{fig:dmax}
\end{figure}

What is the worst case? Referring to Figure~\ref{fig:dmax}, let's assume that an AC is moving in direction $BS_g \rightarrow B$, and that, at a given time $t_g$, $\overrightarrow{AC} \in cell$ and $\overrightarrow{AC} - \overrightarrow{A} < \epsilon$ with $\epsilon$ small as you wish, eg. AC is at point A but still inside the cell where the nearest BS is $BS_g$; and let's assume that, at this time, AC initiates the handover procedure and discovers that the nearest BS is $BS_g$. Immediately after this handover procedure, performed without any penalty time, AC is out of the cell and will not initiate the handover procedure before $t$ time: this means that, when it is in point B, it has traveled for, at least, $d_{max_out} = v t$, since the last handover procedure, and that the longest distance $d$ between AC and BS $d_{max}$ is given by:

$$ d_{max} = \frac{M \sqrt{2}}{2} + vt $$

\section{Application}
\subsection{Requirements}

\subsection{Compile}
To compile the application, just run:
\begin{verbatim}
  $ cd $REPO
  $ make -j$(nproc)
\end{verbatim}

Application's two executables, \texttt{client} and \texttt{server}, will be found in the \texttt{bin} directory.
For simplicity, it is suggested to run them from the repository's root directory.

To compile this documentation, just run:
\begin{verbatim}
  $ cd $REPO/doc
  $ make
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Run}
To run the application just type the following commands in your shell.

\subsection{Repository}% TODO
\projectname{}'s repository is organized in directories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{bin} contains the \texttt{client} and \texttt{server} executable files;
  \item \texttt{cert} contains all the certificates; if the application's server is run on the same host as the client, then this directory can be shared.
  \item \texttt{conf} contains server configuration, eg. a file with authorized clients list;
  \item \texttt{debug} contains some useful commands and configuration files for some common debugging tools like \emph{valgrind} and \emph{gdb};
  \item \texttt{doc} contains the \LaTeX source code of this document;
  \item \texttt{downloads} is the default location for files downloaded from the server by the client;
  \item \texttt{obj} contains object files before their linking;
  \item \texttt{root} is the default and only location allowed for files uploaded to the server;
  \item \texttt{src} contains the application's source code.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
